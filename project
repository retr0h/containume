  June 2015 - Oct 2018

  Molecule is designed to aid in the development and testing of Ansible roles
  including support for multiple instances, operating system distributions,
  virtualization providers and test frameworks.

  Molecule has become the defacto Ansible testing framework, by building a
  community around Molecule through public speaking, meetups, Slack, and mailing
  lists. Helped to Shepherd Molecule's adoption by Redhat into the Ansible
  ecosystem [1].
